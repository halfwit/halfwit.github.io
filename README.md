## Hello!

I'm halfwit! I'm a dad, first and foremost, but also I'm a neurodivergent, celiac, lgbtq+ ally (with a penchant for over-explaining. The following page is a treatise to just that).  I am fascinated with emerging technology, both for the societal implications, and my curiosity. I strive to learn what I am able to in any fundamental field, leveraging my growing base of knowledge to create unique solutions to hard problems.

I am currently working as a full-stack developer, specializing in Laravel/NodeJS, but I don't limit myself to any given technology.

## Other Things?

My main side project has been https://altid.github.io. I wanted to make a software solution that took commonly used applications, and made them highly accessible, highly customizable, and access to them feel ubiquitous. After many iterations, and many great ideas from friends, I was able to land on a design that really enabled all of those fronts. My current work involves writing [client applications](https://altid.github.io/clients) to really showcase what this system can enable.

My side-side project has been largely integrating the networked operating system, [plan9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs) into my computing life! I moved from Linux, to FreeBSD/macOS, and now I'm working to use 9front as my daily driver. Other aspects are data solutions, such as setting up a NAS and a virtualization stack to run most things on (blogs coming soon!). The goal is to have the feel of a thin client that can access my 'world', my preferred desktop environment, programs, and files, without heavy synchronization, cloud hosting, or X-forwarding/VNC style solutions, that tend to not work well on devices outside of personal computers.
